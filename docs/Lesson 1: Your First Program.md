## Making your first program

> This lesson will go over how to make your first program in Python which is one of the most popular, simple and widely used programming languages out there. This will teach basic concepts such as output, input, variables, loops and conditionels. This lesson will assume you have a working Python environment using Python (**3.10.12**) or later.

### Output

> To print text into the conosle, use the print("function)

> ```python
> print("Hello World!")
> ```

> This function will output Hello World! into the terminal. Text must be wrapped within quotes (This is called a string)

> To print a number, you can do the same thing without the quote as numbers are not a string
